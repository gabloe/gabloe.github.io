# Stop eating meat
Over a year ago I started thinking about what I was eating. I mean, I had always *thought* about it, but I'd never really **thought** about it, you know? So, I stopped eating meat, and I feel great about it. I no longer have to worry about indigestion, but I also have the peace of mind that I am not consuming a product that is destroying our planet.

Yes, the consumption of meat is destroying this planet. Period. Did you know that the agricultural industry is responsible for the destruction of forests, which this planet needs to survive? Deforestation is driven in large part by the production of crops used to feed cattle, which are then slaughtered for human consumption. So, by eating meat you are fueling an economy that is having a devastating impact on our climate, and on the thousands of species that die as a response to deforestation and climate change.

Stop eating meat. Start being conscious of what you put into your body. Start thinking about the environmental impact of your actions. We all need this planet to survive.
