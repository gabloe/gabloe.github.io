# Hi, I'm Gabriel
I am one of those progressive liberals that you've been told to be afraid of. I believe in socialism, economic empowerment, workers rights, and an end to the overwhelming amount of corruption that has lead to:
1. Corporate ownership and control of everything
2. A political process that strongly favors the wealthy
3. A rise in white supremacist nationalism
4. A "healthcare" industry that profits by ensuring that people remain sick
5. The slow and torturous death of our planet

You should forget everything you think you know about the world, and start believing in policies that will enrich the lives of all people, and not just the wealthy.

Corporations are not people.
