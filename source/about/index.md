# Hi, I'm Gabriel
I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, but I don't generally like to write about my field of study. I am mostly interested in writing about my observations of the world, my social and political beliefs, and injustices that I believe are causing undue hardship for most creatures living on this planet

I believe in the end of capitalism, economic empowerment, workers rights, and an end to the overwhelming amount of corruption that has lead to:
1. Corporate ownership and control of everything
2. A political process that strongly favors the wealthy
3. A rise in white supremacist nationalism
4. A "healthcare" industry that profits by ensuring that people remain sick
5. The slow and torturous death of our planet

Corporations are not people. Your government should work for you.
